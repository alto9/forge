# Build Procedures and Packaging

## When to Use This Context

Use this context when:
- Building Forge packages for distribution
- Understanding the build process
- Packaging extensions for installation
- Troubleshooting build issues
- Preparing releases

## Build Architecture

```gherkin
Scenario: Understand build architecture
  Given you need to build Forge packages
  When understanding the build process
  Then vscode-extension uses webpack for bundling
  And vscode-extension uses esbuild for webview
  And mcp-server uses TypeScript compiler
  And each package has independent build configuration

Scenario: Build output locations
  Given you run a build
  When checking build outputs
  Then vscode-extension dist/ contains bundled extension.js
  And vscode-extension media/studio/ contains webview bundle
  And mcp-server dist/ contains compiled JavaScript
  And all outputs are optimized for production
```

## VSCode Extension Build Process

### Build Steps

```gherkin
Scenario: Build vscode extension
  Given you are building the extension
  When running the build process
  Then webpack compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
  And webpack bundles all dependencies into dist/extension.js
  And esbuild bundles React webview to media/studio/main.js
  And both outputs are optimized and minified
  And source maps are generated for debugging

Scenario: Production build
  Given you are creating a production build
  When packaging the extension
  Then webpack runs in production mode
  And esbuild minifies the webview bundle
  And source maps are hidden (hidden-source-map)
  And all dependencies are bundled
  And output size is minimized
```

### Build Configuration

- **Main Extension**: Webpack with ts-loader
- **Webview**: esbuild with React bundling
- **Output**: `dist/extension.js` (main), `media/studio/main.js` (webview)
- **Source Maps**: Generated for debugging
- **Dependencies**: All bundled (no node_modules needed)

### Packaging Process

```gherkin
Scenario: Package extension for distribution
  Given you have built the extension
  When packaging for distribution
  Then run `npm run vscode:package` from root
  And this executes production webpack build
  And builds webview with esbuild (minified)
  And runs @vscode/vsce package command
  And creates forge-0.1.0.vsix file
  And bundles are optimized for size

Scenario: Verify package contents
  Given you have created a .vsix file
  When verifying package contents
  Then verify dist/extension.js is included
  And verify media/studio/main.js is included
  And verify package.json metadata is correct
  And verify no node_modules are included
  And verify all dependencies are bundled
```

## MCP Server Build Process

### Build Steps

```gherkin
Scenario: Build MCP server
  Given you are building the MCP server
  When running the build process
  Then TypeScript compiler compiles src/ to dist/
  And uses ES modules (type: "module")
  And preserves directory structure
  And generates .d.ts type definitions
  And makes dist/index.js executable

Scenario: Development vs production build
  Given you are building the server
  When in development mode
  Then tsx watch mode auto-reloads on changes
  When in production mode
  Then TypeScript compiles to optimized JavaScript
  And no source maps needed (runtime dependencies)
```

### Build Configuration

- **Compiler**: TypeScript (tsc)
- **Module System**: ES modules (`"type": "module"`)
- **Output**: `dist/index.js` (executable)
- **Dependencies**: Resolved from node_modules at runtime
- **Executable**: `chmod +x` applied automatically

## Build Commands Reference

### Root Level Commands

```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build

# Watch all packages (if supported)
npm run watch

# Lint all packages
npm run lint

# Clean all build artifacts
npm run clean

# Package vscode extension
npm run vscode:package
```

### Package-Specific Commands

```bash
# VSCode Extension
npm run build -w forge              # Build extension
npm run watch -w forge              # Watch mode
npm run lint -w forge               # Lint
npm run clean -w forge              # Clean

# MCP Server
npm run build -w @forge/mcp-server # Build server
npm run dev -w @forge/mcp-server   # Dev mode (tsx watch)
npm run lint -w @forge/mcp-server  # Lint
npm run clean -w @forge/mcp-server # Clean
```

## Build Optimization

```gherkin
Scenario: Optimize build size
  Given you want to minimize bundle size
  When building the extension
  Then webpack tree-shakes unused code
  And esbuild minifies the webview bundle
  And dependencies are bundled efficiently
  And source maps are excluded from production

Scenario: Optimize build speed
  Given you want faster builds
  When developing locally
  Then use watch mode for incremental builds
  And use tsx for MCP server (faster than tsc)
  And cache node_modules between builds
  And only build packages you're modifying
```

## Troubleshooting Build Issues

```gherkin
Scenario: Build fails with module errors
  Given build fails with module errors
  When troubleshooting
  Then verify all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
  And check workspace links are correct
  And verify package.json dependencies match
  And try cleaning and rebuilding: `npm run clean && npm run build`

Scenario: Webview bundle not updating
  Given webview changes aren't reflected
  When troubleshooting
  Then verify esbuild build completed
  And check media/studio/main.js was updated
  And verify webview cache is cleared
  And reload webview panel in VSCode

Scenario: Extension bundle too large
  Given extension bundle is too large
  When optimizing
  Then check webpack bundle analyzer
  And verify unused dependencies are removed
  And check for duplicate dependencies
  And use production mode builds
```

## Release Process

```gherkin
Scenario: Prepare release build
  Given you are preparing a release
  When building for release
  Then update version in all package.json files
  Then run `npm run build` to build all packages
  Then run `npm run vscode:package` to create .vsix
  Then verify build artifacts are correct
  Then test extension installation
  Then test MCP server functionality
  Then update CHANGELOG.md
```

## Best Practices

### Build Quality

1. **Always test builds**: Verify builds work before committing
2. **Use production mode**: Test production builds before release
3. **Verify bundle sizes**: Check bundle sizes haven't grown unexpectedly
4. **Test installation**: Install .vsix locally to verify packaging
5. **Check dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly bundled

### Development Efficiency

1. **Use watch mode**: For active development, use watch mode
2. **Incremental builds**: Only rebuild what changed
3. **Fast feedback**: Use tsx for MCP server development
4. **Isolated testing**: Test extension in Extension Development Host

### Release Checklist
