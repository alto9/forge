# Developer Actor

## Profile
The Developer is a software engineer who uses Forge to manage context engineering and AI-assisted development workflows. They are responsible for designing features, creating technical specifications, and implementing solutions.

## Goals
- Design software features with clear requirements
- Create technical specifications that guide implementation
- Manage context engineering for AI-assisted development
- Convert design sessions into actionable implementation stories
- Maintain organized project documentation

## Responsibilities
- Define user-facing features using Gherkin scenarios
- Create technical specifications with diagram references
- Design data models and system architecture
- Write context guidance for technical areas
- Generate command files from design sessions to create minimal implementation stories
- Implement code changes based on stories

## Skills
- Software development and architecture
- Requirements analysis and specification writing
- Gherkin scenario writing
- Diagram creation using react-flow visual editor
- Context engineering and prompt design
- AI-assisted development workflows

## Workflow Context
The Developer uses Forge in a session-driven workflow:
1. Starts design sessions for specific problem areas
2. Creates and modifies features, specs, models, and contexts
3. Creates command files from sessions that generate focused implementation stories
4. Implements stories with complete context from linked files

## Pain Points
- Managing complex context for AI agents
- Keeping implementation stories minimal and focused
- Maintaining organized project documentation
- Ensuring complete context without information overload
- Tracking design decisions and their implementation

## Success Criteria
- Clear, actionable implementation stories
- Complete context for AI agents
- Organized, nestable project structure
- Minimal story size (< 30 minutes implementation)
- Effective session-to-implementation workflow
